This repository contains an example of a subtle bug in HTML involving a Javascript error. The bug occurs due to a simple typo in the id of an element, when the Javascript code tries to access an element using getElementById, it fails silently because the element with the correct ID is not found. The solution demonstrates the correction needed to resolve the issue.  The bug is common when dealing with slightly misspelled element IDs, it leads to unexpected behavior without clear error messages, making debugging challenging.
